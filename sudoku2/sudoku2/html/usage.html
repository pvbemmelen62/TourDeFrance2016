<p>
This program allows you to enter a sudoku of size 9 or size 16, and then you
can click a button to start the search for solutions to the sudoku.
</p>
<p>This program handles only sudokus of the simple variant:
<ul>
<li>each column must contain the numbers 1 ... size;</li>
<li>each row must contain the numbers 1 ... size;</li>
<li>each subrectangle must contain the numbers 1 ... size; for sudoku size 9, the subrectangles have size 3; and for sudoku size 16, the subrectangles have
size 4.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>While the program is searching for a solution, it shows the numbers that
it is trying.</p>
<h2><a id="enterSudoku" name="enterSudoku">How to enter a sudoku numbers</a></h2>
<p>
To enter a new sudoku, select File->New... ; next choose the size; and then enter numbers
from the keyboard. Those numbers will be fixed during the search for a solution.
</p>
<p>You can only enter numbers while the search for a solution has not yet started;
i.e. "step count" must be 0. When you can enter numbers, the drawing will show
a cursor (a small vertical line) in the cell where the number will go.
</p>
<p>You can use the arrow keys to move the cursor, the digit keys to enter numbers,
and the backspace key to delete a digit.
</p>
<p>If you have clicked one of the toggles (see below), the drawing where you
enter numbers will have lost the keyboard focus; you can tell because the cursor,
will be gone. In that case click on the drawing, to give it keyboard focus again. 
</p>
<p>While entering numbers, the program will block any input that violates the
sudoku rules. This means that if you entered "1" somewhere in a row, that you
can not enter "12" any more, because to enter "12", you first need to type "1"
and then "2".<br/>
To get around this problem, enter "1" only after you have entered any "10", "11", ... "16".
</p>
<h2><a id="searchSolutions" name="searchSolutions">Search for solutions</a></h2>
<p>
You can click on the "Step" button, and the program will perform one step forward
in its search for a solution.</p>
<p>
Or you can click the "Start" button, and the program will keep on stepping until
it has found a (next) solution, or until it has found that there is no more next
solution.<br/>
The "Start" button, when clicked, will change into a "Stop" button so that clicking
it again, will stop the search.
</p>
<p>The speed with which the program searches a solution, can be reduced by
increasing the delay with the horizontal slider control.
</p>
<p>For fastest speed, choose delay 0. Then, the speed with which the program searches a solution,
will be higher if the program does not update the drawing of the sudoku at every step.</p>
<p>
Therefore, the program allows you to disable the redrawing, by disabling the
"Refresh cells" toggle.<br/>
When you click the "Step" button for a single step, the redrawing always occurs,
irrespective of the toggle.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, you can disable the redrawing of the "step count".
</p>
<p>
When you have disabled both toggles, and you click the "Start" button, you
can not directly see the progress.<br/>
But you can see when the program has found a solution, or has found that there
is no solution, by looking at the "Start/Stop" button.
While the program is searching the button will have label "Stop" ; and when the
search has stopped, the label will show "Start" again.
